#  Welcome to **NuekJS1.3.0 🔥**

> A JS SSR framework built to help build efficient frontend systems.
> Inspired by **NueJS**, the SSR framework written in Rust.
> **May GOD help us all** 🙏🙏🙏

### ⚙️ Installation

Nuek was built to work with CDN which I highly recommend 🌝, but in a large codebase where you actually use a js bundler like Vite you can run the command below.

```bash
npm install nuekjs
```

Or use the available **CDN** https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/nuekjs@latest/scripts/main.js:

Then create a simple static component for a test.

```html
<!-- CDN usage example -->
<script type="module">
  const nodeComponent = new NuekStaticComponent(componentContainer, nuekFilePath, optionalProps, loop, condition,ssr);
</script>
```

---

### Component Setup (`.nuek` files)

To begin, create `.nuek` files — each file contains a single self-contained component.

**Format:**

```html
<script>
  // JavaScript logic
</script>

<component>
  <!-- Your HTML here -->
</component>

<style>
  /* Component-specific CSS */
</style>
```

**⚠️ NOTE:** Please **strictly follow** the format above for consistent behavior.

### Usage in HTML

```html
<!-- Import your .nuek component like this -->
<script type="module">
  let show = true;
  //The last parameter is false because I'm not using SSR btw.
  const nodeElement = new NuekStaticComponent("#app", "/components/Card.nuek", {
    title: "Hello",
    content: "This is from NuekJS!"
  }, 1,show,false);
</script>
```
